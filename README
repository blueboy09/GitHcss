NOTE: the work is base on JCUDA, Please download JCUDA first and add its directory in the System variable PATH.

The work's goal is using GPU accelerate HDPS.If you are a beginner, please see "toy" first and you can get the main idea.


The File Structure:
src: the java source of the work
doc: javadoc about the work
lib: jar files
data: the data for test
jython: jython script
toy: a simple example for testing 

Except time cost classes such as NumCount and TimeCost, here are two operators implented by GPU-- MatrixMultiply and FFT.
After you use jar files in lib to replace your own jar files, you can use:
      GPUinfo.GetGPUInfo()
to get the GPU information about your machine. and use:
   MatrixMultiply.SetGPU(True/False)
   FFTSet.GPU(True/False)
to switch between CPU and GPU.

NOTE: you need change the jar files' name in accordance with your own jar files(the only different you need modify is the version tag) for HIPE.bat starting correctly.
