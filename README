The work is base on JCUDA, Please download JCUDA first and add its directory in the System variable PATH.

The work's goal is using GPU accelerate Herschel Interactive Processing Environment (HIPE). If you are a beginner, please see "toy" first and you can get the main idea.


The File Structure:
src: the java source of the work
doc: javadoc about the work
lib: jar files
data: the data for test
jython: jython script
toy: a simple example for testing 

Except time cost classes such as NumCount and TimeCost, here are two operators implented by GPU-- MatrixMultiply and FFT.
After you use jar files in lib to replace your own jar files, you can use:
      GPUinfo.GetGPUInfo()
to get the GPU information about your machine. The massage is printed in the OS window where HCSS was started. 

Use:
   MatrixMultiply.SetGPU(True/False)
   FFTSet.GPU(True/False)
to switch between CPU and GPU.

NOTE: You need to change the names of the jar files in the lib directory to add version tag for HIPE.bat to start correctly. For example ia_numeric.jar may need to change to  ia_numeric_3.21.jar. 

Some feedback to me, Yifei Jin <m-astro@163.com> and Professor Maohai Huang at NAOC <mhaing@nao.cas.cn>.
